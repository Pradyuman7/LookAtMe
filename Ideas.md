## Ideas:

### 1. Trigger on successive 3 times eye blinking 

- If the user blinks their eyes 3 times in succession, then the app skips to the next video.

- This idea would increase the functionality of the app by giving the user more functions that are easily accessible. Blinking your eyes 3 times doesn't naturally happen, but users can remember the command and execute it quickly. 

- The potential use case for this feature is in a dedicated media player, which requires simple commands that the user can use to interact with the video. 

### 2. Add functionality when eyes are not detected for a long period

- Perhaps turn off until motion is detected or something of this sort that would give more control over the possible scenarios that could occur.

- A use case would be to automatically go into power saving mode while the user is not watching video and doing something else.

### 3. Add a range of sensitivities that can be set by the user 

- Since at times it may be hard to determine if the user actually wishes for the feature to be actuated, it may be a good idea to make it easily adjustable to their liking rather than just having two options, fast and accurate.

- I think a possible use case would be when someone may squint or may have problems with the detection of their eyes. 


### 4. Add functionality for users with glasses 

- Since some users cannot actually watch videos without a pair of glasses, due to one issue or the other, I think it would be great to be able to bypass user glasses or any physical obstruction.

- A possible use case would be to display a friendly error when glasses or any other obstruction is detected, or add another motion functionality specially for users with glasses.
